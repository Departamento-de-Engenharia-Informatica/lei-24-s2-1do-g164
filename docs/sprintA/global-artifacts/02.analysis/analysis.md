# OO Analysis

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used.

## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes
To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development".


### _Conceptual Class Category List_

**Business Transactions**

* n/a

---

**Transaction Line Items**

* n/a

---

**Product/Service related to a Transaction or Transaction Line Item**

* n/a

---

**Transaction Records**

* n/a

---  

**Roles of People or Organizations**

* Role: HRM
* Role: VFM
* Role: Collaborator
* Role: GSM
* Role: GSU

---

**Places**

* Garden
* Medium-sized park
* Large-sized park

---

**Noteworthy Events**

---

**Other External/Collaborating Systems**

* n/a

---

**Records of finance, work, contracts, legal matters**

## Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations:

- **_A_** is physically or logically part of **_B_**
- **_A_** is physically or logically contained in/on **_B_**
- **_A_** is a description for **_B_**
- **_A_** known/logged/recorded/reported/captured in **_B_**
- **_A_** uses or manages or owns **_B_**
- **_A_** is related with a transaction (item) of **_B_**
- etc.
